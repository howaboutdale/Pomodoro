# Pomodoro App

This is a fairly simple React implementation of a Pomodoro Timer and task list.

## :computer: [Pomodoro-Pro](https://pomodoro-pro.surge.sh/) to try the app!

## :page_facing_up: About

**How to use the app:**

1.  The point of the app is to help people retain focus on whatever task they have at hand.
1.  Get your self ready to work and then start the timer, the duration of the timer can be customised to suit your needs.
1.  When the timer reaches zero, you will be rewarded with a short break, this is to avoid burnout/brain-fog, which in turn helps boost your productivity. The duration of the break can also be customised.
1.  Of course there are also options to pause and reset the timer.
1.  As an additional feature there is a task-list. This allows you to produce a list of tasks that you need to work on, if you go to the task list and add a task, you can set that as your current active task. When the timer reaches zero, you will be asked if you managed to complete the task, if you select yes then that task will be added to your completed tasks list. If not, then you can simply go again!

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

The work on this project commenced with a detailed plan on how the app should be layed out, what functionality it will have and what tools will be needed to get started with it.

First, the functionality of the app was written in the form of user stories. Essentially what a user would reasonably expect from the app.

Then the wireframes for the app were put together using Excalidraw:

## :rocket: Cool tech

- Coding languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
- Framework: React.
- Code editor: Visual Studio Code.
- Deployment: Surge.
- Libraries: Materials UI/Icons.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:

- The timer resembles a fidget spinner when customizing the duration, although one could argue that this is a feature.

## :sob: Lessons learnt

- Frequent and succinct git commits assist in telling a clear story.
- Avoid convoluted and repetitive code.
- Making notes on each part of the code that is a little complicated or open to interpretation.
- When debugging, change very small parts of the code, even if it's one line, then check to see if it's changed anything.

## :white_check_mark: Future features

- User Accounts
- Dark Mode
- Sounds for timer completion
